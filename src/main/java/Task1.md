### 1. **Understanding the Class and Method Structure**

The code is organized in a class called `Task1`. In Java, every program must be inside a class. Classes are containers for code and help organize it. Here, the class `Task1` has two methods:
- **`main`**: This is the entry point of the program. When you run the program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the `main` method to know where to start executing the code.
- **`countVowels`**: This method is defined to count and return the number of vowels in a given string. It takes a `String` (text) as an input and returns an integer (the count of vowels found).

### 2. **Main Method (`main`)**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
```

This is the `main` method where the program starts running. Let's break down what it does:

1. **Test Cases**:
    - The code inside `main` uses the `countVowels` method to check how many vowels are in a few specific strings.
    - Each line calls `countVowels` with a different string and compares the result to an expected value (like `11` or `18`). If the result isn’t what’s expected, it prints `"Test failed"`.

   Here’s an example of one of these checks:

   ```java
   if (countVowels("Your Digital Career Starts Here") != 11) {
       System.out.println("Test failed");
   }
   ```

   In this line:
    - The program counts the vowels in the string `"Your Digital Career Starts Here"`.
    - If the count isn’t `11`, it prints `"Test failed"` to let the user know the program didn’t work as expected for this case.

   This approach checks whether `countVowels` is working correctly.

### 3. **The `countVowels` Method**

The `countVowels` method does the actual counting of vowels.

```java
public static int countVowels(String str) { ... }
```

- `public`: This makes the method accessible from anywhere.
- `static`: Means this method belongs to the class itself and can be called without creating an object of the class.
- `int`: This method returns an integer value (the count of vowels).
- `countVowels(String str)`: This is the method name, `countVowels`, and it takes a `String` input named `str`.

Inside this method:

1. **Initialize a Counter**:
   ```java
   int vowels = 0;
   ```
   This line creates a variable called `vowels` and sets it to `0`. This variable will store the count of vowels as the program goes through each character in the string.

2. **Convert String to Character Array**:
   ```java
   char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
   ```
   Here, the string `str` is converted into an array of characters, named `chars`. This allows the program to examine each individual character in the string, one at a time.

3. **Loop Through Each Character**:
   ```java
   for (char c : chars) { ... }
   ```
   The `for` loop goes through each character in the `chars` array. For each character, it checks if the character is a vowel.

4. **Check for Vowels**:
   ```java
   switch (c) {
       case 'a':
       case 'e':
       case 'i':
       case 'o':
       case 'u':
           vowels++;
           break;
       default:
           break;
   }
   ```
   The `switch` statement checks if the character `c` is one of the vowels: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`. If it finds a match, it increases the `vowels` count by 1 (`vowels++`).

5. **Return the Vowel Count**:
   ```java
   System.out.println("Number of vowels in the string '" + str + "': " + vowels);
   return vowels;
   ```
   After going through all characters, it prints the number of vowels found in the string. Finally, the method returns the `vowels` count to wherever it was called from.

### Summary

- **`main` Method**: Calls `countVowels` with different test strings and checks if the results match expected values.
- **`countVowels` Method**: Counts vowels in a given string by converting it to a character array, looping through each character, and checking if it’s a vowel.
