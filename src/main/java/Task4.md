### Overview of the Program

This program is designed to repeat a given string a specified number of times, appending a unique number to each repetition, with spaces in between. For example:
- Given the input `"number"` and `3`, the output would be `"number1 number2 number3"`.
- Given `"article"` and `5`, the output would be `"article1 article2 article3 article4 article5"`.

### Structure of the Code

The program has a class called `Task4`, with:
- A `main` method to test if the `repeat` method works as expected.
- A helper method `repeat`, which performs the string concatenation.

### 1. **The `main` Method**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (repeat("number", 3).equals("number1 number2 number3") == false) {
        System.out.println("Test failed");
    }

    if (repeat("article", 5).equals("article1 article2 article3 article4 article5") == false) {
        System.out.println("Test failed");
    }
}
```

This `main` method is used to test if the `repeat` method works correctly. Let’s break it down:

1. **Calling `repeat` Method and Checking the Output**:
   ```java
   if (repeat("number", 3).equals("number1 number2 number3") == false) {
       System.out.println("Test failed");
   }
   ```
    - The `repeat` method is called with `"number"` and `3` as inputs.
    - This produces a string, which is checked to see if it equals `"number1 number2 number3"`.
    - If it does not match, the program prints `"Test failed"` to indicate something went wrong.

2. **Additional Test Case**:
   ```java
   if (repeat("article", 5).equals("article1 article2 article3 article4 article5") == false) {
       System.out.println("Test failed");
   }
   ```
   This line tests the `repeat` method with different inputs (`"article"` and `5`). If the output isn’t `"article1 article2 article3 article4 article5"`, it prints `"Test failed"`.

### 2. **The `repeat` Method**

The `repeat` method performs the main functionality of this program—concatenating a string with a counter multiple times, separated by spaces.

```java
public static String repeat(String str, int n) { ... }
```

- **Parameters**:
    - `str`: The string to repeat and number.
    - `n`: The number of times to repeat the string.

- **Return Value**:
    - This method returns a single `String` with `str` concatenated `n` times, with a number attached to each repetition.

Inside this method:

1. **Using `StringBuilder` for Efficient String Concatenation**:
   ```java
   StringBuilder stringConcat = new StringBuilder();
   ```
   `StringBuilder` is used to build the final string. Unlike normal string concatenation, `StringBuilder` is efficient for repeated appends, which is important when concatenating many strings.

2. **Looping to Concatenate the String with Number**:
   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
       stringConcat.append(str).append(i).append(" ");
   }
   ```
   This loop runs from `1` to `n` and:
    - Adds `str` to `stringConcat`.
    - Appends the current value of `i` (which increments each loop).
    - Adds a space after each repetition.

   For example, if `str` is `"number"` and `n` is `3`, the loop would produce:
   ```
   "number1 " + "number2 " + "number3 "
   ```

3. **Trimming the Extra Space**:
   ```java
   return stringConcat.toString().trim();
   ```
   The `trim` method removes any extra spaces at the beginning or end of the final string. This ensures that there’s no trailing space after the last repetition.

   For example:
   ```
   "number1 number2 number3 "
   ```
   becomes:
   ```
   "number1 number2 number3"
   ```

### Summary

- **`main` Method**: Tests the `repeat` method with specific inputs and checks if the output is correct.
- **`repeat` Method**: Concatenates the given string `n` times, adding a number to each repetition and separating them with spaces. The final string is returned without any trailing spaces.

When this code runs, it tests the `repeat` method and will print `"Test failed"` if any test does not produce the expected result.
